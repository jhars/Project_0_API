Project Outline:

Make your basic user narrative, schema drawing, and Kanban board. These are required!
Start by creating a basic project and push to a public repo. Make frequent commits and pushes (every hour or so). Include a very, VERY short README.md that outlines what your app does and the libraries you are using.
Make your initial layout. Use default Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS.
Make a list of posts using Underscore.js templates and jQuery (and Object Oriented Programming!).
Make a form to add new posts to the list using Underscore.js templates and jQuery.
Be sure to comment your code, and make the code clean (mind spacing and indentation).
Stretch Challenges (optional)

1. Add a count of how many posts have been posted that updates every time a new post is created.
2. Add a Bootstrap JS component like a tooltip.
3. Add more custom CSS to make it very beautiful :)
4. Add Model object that saves posts to localStorage.
5. Add comments on posts.



Ryde HQ Micro Blog

The RHQ blog will allow users to make blog posts through a Modal object (or a simple form). The app (RHQ blog) will also allow users to comment on other blog posts and will keep track of how many posts & comments have been made.

I will use the follwoing libraies for the following purposes:

Underscore.js -- for post templating & HOPEFULLY to iterate through localStorage in order to sync up window & data information
 
jQuery - to identify where to pull information for the Underscrore.js template

OOP - in order to untilize constructor functions (build objects from pre-designated object-strucutres) and object prototypes (methods)

Bootstrap - for formatting, styling & adding simple js functionality like tooltips or show/hide features. Also will utilize this for the Modal object
